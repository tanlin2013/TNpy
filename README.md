# Tensor-Network
This project contains several algorithms which are based on the Matrix Product State (MPS) ansatz, and is used for the studies of physics in (1+1) dimensions. 

* Infinite Size Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG)
* Infinte Time Evolution Bond Decimation (iTEBD)
* Finite Size Density Matrix Renormalization Group (fDMRG)
* Finte Time Evolution Bond Decimation (fTEBD)
